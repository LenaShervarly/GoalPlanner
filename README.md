# Goal Planner

A free-to-use android application to set current goals on the base of life purposes. Inspired by book "The 12 Week Year" by Brian Morgan.
Currently at prototype stage.

## To begin with choose a time Frame:



## Select a category or create a new one


## Set a define goal within the chosen category



## Share your goals with friends

That's it at the moment. To be continue :)
